# sql-challenge 
For this sql challenge I recieved feedback and most importantly guideness from a tutor. 
In order to create the EDR for the tables QuickDBD was the tool of choice that was selected for the diagrams.

Outline:
Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site
